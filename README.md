### Description 
The **QCFirst** web application was designed with the user in mind. Many universities over burden their web applications, make finding pertinent information more difficult to find than gold, have an unresponsive design that limits the user to their desktop and are using outdated technologies that make it impossible for the web application to scale and update when new features are available. The **QCFirst** was designed and created to ensure that all the former complaints are nothing more than an after thought. **QCFirst** was created to be responsive on all devices, to ensure that the user has the capability to perform database-centric tasks on the site itself, and utilizes sophisticated frameworks/tools to give the web application powerful functionality. Oh, and the site is not only for students, it was built to support teachers as well as students. 

## Technical Specifications 
The **QCFirst** was designed with the following *stack*;<br>
 *1)* **MongoDB** a cross-platform document oriented database which gives the website to ability to: Ad-hoc queries, store files, allow for server-side query execution, and comes readily available with a list of server-side JavaScript technologies. <br>
 *2)* **Node.js** is an open source, cross-platform back-end JavaScript runtime environemnt. It helps in running scripts server-side to produce the beautiful, dynamic web pages that **QCFirst** has to offer. It is widely used in web development, due to its ability to unify web-applications and its collection of modules taht handle various core functionalities. <br>
 *3)* **Express.js** a back end web application framework that was designed for building sophisticated web applications. Express is a framework that runs within **Node.js** that provides the means for a developer to create and maintain robust servers. **Express.js** comes with many built-in features that give **QCFirst** better functionality, increased security and help improve query speed. <br>
 *4)* **Front End** Graphic User Interface was made aesthetic and pleasing to the user experience using the **Bootstrap** library<br>
 *5)* **Front End** was created with the following languages: *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript*.
 *6)* **Back End** is making use of the following: Passport, Mongoose, AccessControl.

## Summary 
QCFirst 2.0 was completely re-innovated as per the feedback on delieverable 3 which was centered primarily around the front-end and the lack of responsiveness.  The website is entirely different from the initial visual designs.  The visual designs had a lot of "bloat" that translated into a poorly thought-out QCFirst 1.0 website.  With QCFirst 2.0, all of the unnecessary elements were stripped away.  Which led to a greater focus on delivering the needs of a user, namely adding courses, dropping courses, and seeing their schedule in an easy manner.  This focus also led to a more responsive design so that a user will have the same experience whether they access the site through a mobile device, tablet, or desktop/laptop.
