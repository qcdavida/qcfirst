<u>**Team Member 1**</u> David Acuqui: Played a major role in the overall design, and re-design of QCFirst into QCFIRST 2.0. David not only served in the capacity as a project manager, but as well as the technical back-end lead. His technical subject matter expertise allowed him to delegate tasks, and push out delieverables in a timely manner. He was responsible for the original design of QCFirst, the re-design of QCFirst, the implementation of the *web application stack* that was used in building QCFirst. David handled much of the database integration, as well as building the skeleteon of QCFirst and served in the capacity as senior-developer. David is continuing to work, finalize the authentication process that was begun but unable to be completed by Jonathan. In addition he provided invaluable subject matter expertise in the layout, creation, deployement and critical analysis of the QCFirst. <br>

### Description 
The **QCFirst** web application was designed with the user in mind. Many universities over burden thier web applications, make finding pertinent information more difficult to find than gold, have an unresponsive design that limits the user to thier desktop and are using outdated technologies that make it impossible for the web application to scale and update when new features are available. The **QCFirst** was designed and created to ensure that all the former complaints are nothing more than an after thought. **QCFirst** was created to be responsive on all devices, to ensure that the user has the capability to perform database-centric tasks on the site itself, and utilizes sophisticated frameworks/tools to give the web application powerful functionality. Oh, and the site is not only for students, it was built to support teachers as well as students. 

## Technical Specifications 
The **QCFirst** was designed with the following *stack*;<br>
 *1)* **MongoDB** a cross-platform document oriented database which gives the website to ability to: Ad-hoc queries, store files, allow for server-side query execution, and comes readily available with a list of server-side JavaScript technologies. <br>
 *2)* **Node.js** is an open source, cross-platform back-end JavaScript runtime environemnt. It helps in running scripts server-side to produce the beautiful, dynamic web pages that **QCFirst** has to offer. It is widely used in web development, due to its ability to unify web-applications and its collection of modules taht handle various core functionalities. <br>
 *3)* **Express.js** a back end web application framework that was designed for building sophisticated web applications. Express is a framework that runs within **Node.js** that provides the means for a developer to create and maintain robust servers. **Express.js** comes with many built-in features that give **QCFirst** better functionality, increased security and help improve query speed. <br>
 *4)* **Front End** Graphic User Interface was made aesthetic and pleasing to the user experience using the **Bootstrap** library<br>
 *5)* **Front End** was created with the following languages: *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript*.

## Summary 
QCFirst 2.0 was completely re-innovated as per the feedback on delieverable 3 which was centered primarily around the front-end and the lack of responsiveness. At this time much of the back-end functionality is still not complete, albeit much of the foundational groundwork has been integrated as of QCFirst 2.0. QCFirst development team ran into issues with the user authetnication process, as well as dynamically rendering and obtaining information in real time with QCFirst 2.0. Q&A spent the majority of the last few days troubleshooting and seeking solutions/workarounds to the persistent issues we are currently having with QCFirst 2.0. QCFirst 2.0 deployment team feels strongly that with feedback, some guidance QCFirst 2.0 can hit all the necessary requirments and produce a product that not only delievers on the necessary requirments but is an overall enjoyable experience to the user.
